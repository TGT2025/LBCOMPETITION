# 🎉 LB Competition Draw – June 2025

## ✅ Timestamp used:
`2025-06-01 23:59:59 UTC`

## 🔐 SHA256 of timestamp:

## 📄 How it works (provably fair)
1. Every order marked **sent** between 15 April and 1 June was extracted.
2. Each order number was saved into `entries.txt`.
3. A **public timestamp** was chosen as the seed.
4. That seed was hashed with SHA256 and used to initialize a random number generator.
5. We picked 5 winners **randomly, fairly, and verifiably**.
6. Anyone can re-run the draw using the exact same inputs and script.
