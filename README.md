🏆 LB Competition Draw – June 2025
✅ Timestamp used:
2025-06-01 23:59:59 UTC

🔐 SHA256 of timestamp:
1a41f1f14573a2d4f2defced48f0b92231e33ff2533b089bd9bd75d0153b8694

📄 How it works (provably fair):
Every order marked sent between 15 April and 1 June was extracted.

Each order number was saved into entries.txt.

A public timestamp was chosen as the seed.

That seed was hashed with SHA256 and used to initialize a random number generator.

We picked 5 winners randomly, fairly, and verifiably.

Anyone can re-run the draw using the exact same inputs and script.

🧪 How to Verify:
Download this repo (or clone it):

Run this command in terminal or PowerShell:

bash
Copy code
python draw.py
Enter the same timestamp:

yaml
Copy code
2025-06-01 23:59:59 UTC
You’ll get the same 5 winners ✅
